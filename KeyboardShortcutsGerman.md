> Hey, not sure if this is the right place or a new issue should be opened.
> Came across this issue after trying to use shortcuts on a german keyboard.
> They aren't document under the `Help` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts` popup.
> I managed to find most of them, but others may gave up and couldn't enjoy the p5-webeditor in all it's glory.
> So properly good to add them into the popup as well, unfortunately i don't know how, but following is a list of my corresponding shortcuts.
